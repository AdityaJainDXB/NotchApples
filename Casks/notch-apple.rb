  caveats <<~EOS
    Notch apple is free and open source but not notarized by Apple.
    The first time you open it, macOS may block it. To allow it, go to
    System Settings → Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway".

    The free version is complete. Pro ($1) and Ultimate ($5) are optional
    one-time upgrades (no subscription, every 1.x update included):
